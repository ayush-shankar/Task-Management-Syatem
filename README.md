# Task-Management-Syatem
 
Creating a database for a task management system involves several important steps. First, we identify what the system needs, like creating and assigning tasks, setting deadlines, and tracking progress. Then, we design a structured database with tables for tasks, users, and projects to store and organize data efficiently. We write SQL queries to manage the data, ensuring they are fast and effective.

To keep the data accurate and secure, we set up rules like primary keys and control user access with permissions. We also plan for regular backups to prevent data loss. Throughout the process, we test the database to fix any problems and ensure it can handle growth as the system expands. These steps help create a reliable and efficient database for managing tasks.
